# Introduction to Reactive Extensions

This is the code for the talk I'm giving at our [Hamburg C# Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Hamburg-C-Net-Meetup/events/193655972/). 
It contains small examples and only serves as an introduction for getting started. 

Slides for the talk are [here](http://slides.com/kjellski/reactive-extensions#/).
